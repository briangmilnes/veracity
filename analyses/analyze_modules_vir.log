=== ABSTRACT ===

This report analyzes vstd (Verus Standard Library) usage across 11 Verus projects
by parsing VIR (Verus IR) files.

Key findings:
  - 10 of 11 projects use vstd (90.9%)
  - 24 unique vstd types
  - 32 unique vstd methods (Type::method)
  - 32 type-method pairs

=== 1. OVERVIEW ===

================================================================================

This report analyzes vstd usage by parsing VIR (Verus IR) files. VIR is Verus's
fully-typed intermediate representation, generated by running 'verus --log vir'.
VIR files are S-expressions containing:
  - Datatype definitions: (Datatype :name (Dt Path "vstd!seq.Seq.") ...)
  - Function definitions: (Function :name (Fun :path "vstd!seq.Seq.empty.") ...)
  - Proxy mappings: :proxy "vstd!std_specs.vec.ExVec." (vstd specs for stdlib)
  - Source locations: (@ "vstd/seq.rs:31:1: 33:2" ...)

VIR files are located at: <project>/.verus-log/crate.vir

NOTE: vstd itself is EXCLUDED from this analysis. We analyze user projects that
USE vstd, not vstd's internal definitions. This avoids inflating counts with
vstd-internal types like RwLock's 91 state machine methods.

2. VSTD TYPES

   This helps us answer: Which vstd types are most widely used?

   Lists 24 vstd types found in VIR, including both native vstd types (Seq, Set,
   Map, Ghost, Tracked) and vstd-wrapped stdlib types (Vec, Option, Result).
   Sorted by project count.

3. VSTD METHODS

   This helps us answer: Which vstd methods are used most often?

   Lists 32 vstd methods as Type::method, sorted by project count.

4. METHODS PER TYPE

   This helps us answer: For each type, which methods are used and how often?

   For each type, shows all methods with percentage of type-users that use each.

5. GREEDY COVER: TYPES (FULL PROJECT SUPPORT)

   This helps us answer: How many types must we verify to FULLY SUPPORT X%% of projects?

   Unlike 'touching' analysis, this computes the minimum types needed so that X%%
   of projects have ALL their types verified. A project is 'fully supported' only
   when every type it uses has been verified.

6. GREEDY COVER: METHODS (FULL PROJECT SUPPORT)

   This helps us answer: How many methods must we verify to FULLY SUPPORT X%% of projects?

   Same as type cover but for methods.

7. PROJECT TYPE REQUIREMENTS

   This helps us answer: What types does each project require?

   Lists each project with all vstd types it uses.

8. GREEDY COVER: METHODS PER TYPE

   This helps us answer: For each type, how many methods must we verify?

   For each type with multiple users, shows greedy cover for its methods.

9. SUMMARY

   Final statistics and timing.
