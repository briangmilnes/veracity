# Accept Hole Rule

Patterns that mark known verification gaps or expected failures must **not** be added unless the user explicitly instructs it.

## Covered patterns

| Pattern | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `// accept hole` | Comment near `external_body`; Veracity treats as info |
| `accept(...)` / `proof { accept(cond); }` | APAS accept proof fn; replaces `assume` for intentional holes |

## Rule

- **DO NOT** add these patterns proactively.
- **DO NOT** add them to silence verification errors or proof-hole reports.
- **DO** add them only when the user explicitly says to (e.g., "add accept hole", "mark as accepted", "add APAS accept").

## Rationale

These annotations document known gaps. Adding them without explicit approval can hide real issues or mask incomplete verification.

## When the user asks

If the user says "add accept hole", "mark as accepted", "APAS accept", or similar, add the requested annotation at the specified location.
