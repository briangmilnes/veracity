# Propose New Work

When the user says "propose new work", "proposed work table", or "retable", generate a table of actionable work from the proof holes report. Output in Cursor chat only (no file).

## Procedure

1. Run proof holes chapter by chapter on the agent's assigned chapters:
   ```bash
   for ch in Chap02 Chap03 Chap05 Chap06 Chap11 Chap12 Chap17 Chap18 Chap19 Chap21 Chap23 Chap26 Chap27 Chap28 Chap35 Chap36 Chap37 Chap38 Chap39 Chap40 Chap41; do
     ~/projects/veracity/target/release/veracity-review-proof-holes -d "src/$ch/"
   done
   ```

2. For each holed file, determine whether it has **proposed work**:
   - **Yes**: non-standard assume, external_body hiding algorithmic logic, bare_impl (except iter_mut/recursive-spec-fn)
   - **No**: accepted patterns only — PartialEq assume, Clone assume, `assume(false); diverge()` in thread join, external_body at threading boundaries, external_body at AtomicUsize (Chap12)

3. List only files with proposed work. If a chapter has multiple holed files, include only those with proposed work (e.g., Chap19: ArraySeqMtEphSlice has bare_impl; ArraySeqMtEph/StEph/StPer have PartialEq only → list only ArraySeqMtEphSlice).

4. Output table format:
   | # | Chapter | Holed Files | Proposed Work |
   Cells ≤ 40 chars. Avoid the word "in" in cells (use "lacking" not "without").

5. Skip chapters with no proposed work. Do not include rows where all holes are accepted patterns.

## Permanent external_body (no proposed work)

- Chap02 HFSchedulerMtEph: threading boundary
- Chap12 Exercise12_1, Exercise12_5: AtomicUsize operations
- Chap35 OrderStatSelectMtEph/MtPer: parallel partition
- Chap38 BSTParaMtEph: threading boundary
- Chap39 BSTParaTreapMtEph: threading boundary
