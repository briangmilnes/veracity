# Use Help-First Scheduler

For parallel scheduling, use the project's bounded help-first scheduler:

```
src/Chap02/HFSchedulerMtEph.rs
```

Do not use raw `std::thread::spawn` or `vstd::thread::spawn` for fork-join parallelism. Use the help-first scheduler which provides proper task management with bounded parallelism and deadlock prevention.
