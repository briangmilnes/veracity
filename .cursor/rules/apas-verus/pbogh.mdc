# APAS-VERUS Project Goal

The goal of APAS-VERUS is to formally verify all algorithms from "A Practical Approach to Data Structures" using Verus.

When working on implementations or proofs:

- **Primary objective**: Get the code to verify (prove) with Verus
- Run `verus` verification after making changes
- Fix verification errors before moving on
- If verification fails, analyze the error and adjust invariants, preconditions, or proof hints
- Prefer verified code over unverified code, even if it requires restructuring
- **Never sequentialize parallel files**: Mt (multi-threaded) implementations must remain parallel. Do not replace threaded code with sequential loops just to satisfy the verifier. If Verus cannot verify the threading, leave the `external_body` rather than destroying the parallelism.
- **Never propose serializing Mt algorithms** without first exhausting all options for verified parallelism (e.g., HF Scheduler `join`, closure specs) AND getting explicit user approval. The default answer to "should we make this Mt code sequential?" is **no**.
