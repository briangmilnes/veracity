# APAS-VERUS Project Goal

The goal of APAS-VERUS is to formally verify all algorithms from "A Practical Approach to Data Structures" using Verus.

When working on implementations or proofs:

- **Primary objective**: Get the code to verify (prove) with Verus
- Run `verus` verification after making changes
- Fix verification errors before moving on
- If verification fails, analyze the error and adjust invariants, preconditions, or proof hints
- Prefer verified code over unverified code, even if it requires restructuring
