# Failed Experiments

When an experiment file fails verification:

- **DO NOT** modify it to pass (no adding `assume`, no commenting out failing assertions)
- **DO NOT** remove dead code — failed attempts stay as documentation
- **DO** add a `RESULT: FAILS` comment at the top explaining what fails
- **DO** comment out the module in `lib.rs` so the project validates

Failed experiments are valuable documentation of what Verus cannot (yet) do.

## Example

```rust
//! Proof time test: Does X work?
//! RESULT: FAILS - assertion on line 30 cannot be proven

// ... original failing code unchanged ...
```

In `lib.rs`:
```rust
//    pub mod experiment_that_fails;  // FAILS - see file header
```
