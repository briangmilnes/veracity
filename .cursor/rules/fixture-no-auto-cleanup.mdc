# Fixture Cleanup Policy

**NEVER clean up or restore `tests/fixtures/APAS-VERUS` unless the user explicitly asks.**

After reordering or modifying the fixture, leave it in its modified state. The user may want to inspect the results.

When the user does ask to refresh the fixture, the correct procedure is:

```bash
cd /home/milnes/projects/veracity/tests/fixtures
rm -rf APAS-VERUS
git clone https://github.com/briangmilnes/APAS-VERUS.git APAS-VERUS
```

The fixture is in `.gitignore` — `git checkout` and `git restore` have no effect on it.
