# Running Verus

The default way to run Verus verification on this project:

```bash
cd ~/projects/APAS-VERUS && ~/projects/verus/source/target-verus/release/verus --crate-type=lib src/lib.rs --multiple-errors 20 --expand-errors
```

Use this command when:
- Checking if code verifies
- After making changes to proofs or implementations
- Before committing changes

## Important

- **Always call `verus` directly** — never use `cargo verus`, `cargo build`, or any cargo-based compilation for verification.
- Verus includes its own vstd automatically — do not pass `-L dependency`, `--extern vstd`, or any library paths.
- There is no need for `target/debug/` or `target/release/` directories for verification. Verus manages its own dependencies.

## Output Display

Always show the full output from verus verification:
- Use `head -100` to limit to 100 lines if needed
- Never use `grep` to filter verus output
- Show complete verification results including all errors and warnings
- **Always echo the output into your response text as a markdown code block** - do not rely on the terminal widget which collapses output
