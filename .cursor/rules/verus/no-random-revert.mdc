# No Random Revert

This is coding **plus proving**. It requires more effort and human interaction than ordinary programming.

## Do not

- Revert to previous states without asking the user first
- Suggest reverting as a fix for small or fixable problems
- Treat verification failures as a signal to undo work

## Do

- Ask before reverting: "Should I revert these changes, or would you prefer to fix forward?"
- Treat reverts as a last resort, not a default response to failure
- Preserve the current state when stuck; report the failure and ask how to proceed

## Rationale

Proof engineering is iterative. A verification failure is data, not a reason to undo. Reverting discards evidence and may hide the root cause. The user may want to fix forward, debug the failure, or discuss the approach before any revert.
