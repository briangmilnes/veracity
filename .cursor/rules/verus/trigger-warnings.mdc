# Trigger Warnings

## Workflow

1. During initial development, use `#![auto]` on `forall`/`exists` quantifiers to let Verus choose triggers automatically.
2. Then remove the `#![auto]` and run Verus to see the proposed trigger warnings.
3. Replace `#![auto]` with the explicit `#[trigger]` that Verus proposes.

## Rules

- Do not leave `#![auto]` in final code — replace with explicit triggers.
- Do not leave trigger warnings in final code.
