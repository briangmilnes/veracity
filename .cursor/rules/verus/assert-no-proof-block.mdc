In Verus, `assert` statements inside executable (`fn`) code do **not** need to be wrapped in a `proof { }` block. Only proof-mode calls (like lemma invocations, `reveal`, ghost variable bindings with `let ghost`, etc.) require a `proof { }` block. Plain `assert(...)` can appear directly in exec code.
