# Cargo Sync

When adding, deleting, or renaming a file that is registered in Cargo.toml (e.g., test files, binaries, examples):

- **Add**: Add the corresponding `[[test]]`, `[[bin]]`, or `[[example]]` entry
- **Delete**: Remove the corresponding entry
- **Rename**: Update the `name` and `path` in the corresponding entry

Do not leave Cargo.toml out of sync with the file system.
