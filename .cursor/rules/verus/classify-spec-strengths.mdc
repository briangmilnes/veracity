# Classify Spec Strengths

## Generate

When the user says "review specs for", "generate spec review for", or provides directories/files
to analyze, first generate the markdown and JSON:

```bash
~/projects/veracity/target/release/veracity-review-module-fn-impls -d src/ChapNN
```

Or for specific files:

```bash
~/projects/veracity/target/release/veracity-review-module-fn-impls -f src/ChapNN/File.rs
```

Multiple directories can be combined in one run (`-d src/Chap05 -d src/Chap18`).

Output goes to `analyses/veracity-review-module-fn-impls.md` and `.json`.

## Classify

When the user says "classify spec strengths", "review spec strengths", "classify specs",
or similar:

### Inputs

- **JSON file**: `analyses/veracity-review-module-fn-impls.json` (or a path the user provides)
- **Prompt**: `~/projects/veracity/docs/veracity-classify-spec-strengths-prompt.md`

### Procedure

1. Read `~/projects/veracity/docs/veracity-classify-spec-strengths-prompt.md` to understand the classification criteria.
2. Read the JSON file the user specifies (default: `analyses/veracity-review-module-fn-impls.json` in the current project).
3. For each entry, examine the `snippet` field and classify `spec_strength` as one of:
   - **strong** — `requires` and `ensures` fully capture the function's contract.
   - **partial** — some spec exists but is incomplete or underspecified.
   - **weak** — spec exists but is trivially true or nearly useless.
   - **none** — no `requires`/`ensures` at all (empty snippet or signature only).
4. Write the classifications to `analyses/review-module-fn-impl-spec-strengths.json` in the same directory as the input JSON. Format:
   ```json
   [
     { "id": 1, "spec_strength": "strong" },
     { "id": 2, "spec_strength": "none" }
   ]
   ```
5. Run the patch command:
   ```bash
   veracity-review-module-fn-impls --patch \
     analyses/veracity-review-module-fn-impls.md \
     analyses/review-module-fn-impl-spec-strengths.json
   ```
6. Print a summary table:
   | Classification | Count |
   |---------------|-------|
   | strong | N |
   | partial | N |
   | weak | N |
   | none | N |

## Classification Guidelines

- A function with **no snippet** or a snippet that is just the signature with no `requires`/`ensures` → **none**.
- A function with `ensures true` or `ensures self == self` → **weak**.
- A function whose `ensures` mentions return value and key state but misses edge cases or doesn't constrain all parameters → **partial**.
- A function whose `requires` + `ensures` together fully describe the input/output contract (preconditions, postconditions, return value, relevant state changes) → **strong**.
- When in doubt between partial and strong, prefer **partial** — it's better to flag for human review than to miss a gap.

## Do NOT

- Do not modify the source `.rs` files.
- Do not modify the `.md` file by hand — always use `--patch`.
- Do not skip entries — every `id` in the input must appear in the output.
