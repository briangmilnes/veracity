# Updating Verus

When updating or rebuilding the Verus project at `~/projects/verus`:

1. Read the build instructions first:
   - `~/projects/verus/INSTALL.md` - overview and binary releases
   - `~/projects/verus/BUILD.md` - building from source (this is what you need)

2. The standard process is:
   ```bash
   cd ~/projects/verus
   git fetch && git pull
   cd source
   source ../tools/activate
   vargo build --release
   ```

3. If the Rust toolchain version changed, install it first:
   ```bash
   rustup toolchain install
   ```

Do NOT use `cargo build` directly - Verus requires `vargo` for its custom build process.
