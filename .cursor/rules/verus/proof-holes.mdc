# Check for Proof Holes

ALWAYS use `veracity-review-proof-holes` for any proof hole related query. Do NOT use grep or manual searching.

```bash
~/projects/veracity/target/release/veracity-review-proof-holes -d src/
```

Or for a specific directory:

```bash
~/projects/veracity/target/release/veracity-review-proof-holes -d src/Chap05/
```

## What It Detects

| Hole Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `assume(false)` | Assumes a contradiction (proves anything) |
| `assume(...)` | Assumes arbitrary conditions without proof |
| `admit()` | Explicitly admits without proof |
| `#[verifier::external_body]` | Body not verified |
| `#[verifier::external_fn_specification]` | External function spec |
| `#[verifier::external]` | Fully external |

## STOP: Ask Before Adding Proof Holes

**NEVER add `#[verifier::external_body]`, `admit()`, or `assume(...)` without first asking the user for permission.** These introduce unverified assumptions and must be explicitly approved.

## When to Run

- When asked to report/show/list/find proof holes (any such query)
- After completing a proof function
- Before committing proof work
- When claiming a module is "proven"

## Understanding Results

- **Clean**: No unverified assumptions - the proof is complete
- **Holed**: Contains at least one proof hole - more work needed

A proof is not truly complete until it reports as clean.
