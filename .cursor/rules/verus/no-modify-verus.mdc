# Do Not Modify Verus Source

**Never** modify files in `~/projects/verus/`.

This includes:
- `~/projects/verus/source/vstd/` (the verified standard library)
- `~/projects/verus/source/rust_verify/`
- Any other files in the Verus repository

If a change to Verus/vstd seems necessary:
1. Document what change would be needed
2. Suggest filing an issue or PR upstream
3. Find a workaround within APAS-VERUS

The user maintains Verus separately and any modifications must go through their own process.
