# Preserve Sketch Names

When the user sketches a function signature, data type, or partial implementation and asks you to complete it:

- **DO NOT** rename parameters, fields, return values, or type names
- **DO NOT** "improve" naming without asking
- **DO**: Use exactly the names the user provided

If you believe a name should be changed, ask first:

> "You named this `n_set_rest_set`. Should I keep that or would you prefer `parts`?"

## Rationale

The user chose those names deliberately. They may:
- Match existing conventions in the codebase
- Align with documentation or specifications
- Have meaning the AI doesn't understand

Changing names without permission breaks the user's mental model and wastes time reverting.
