# If You Think Verus Can't Do X

When you believe Verus cannot do something (e.g., "Verus doesn't support X", "This pattern won't verify"):

1. **Ask the user** if they want you to search `src/experiments/` for an existing test of this capability

2. **If searching**: Look for existing experiment files that test this pattern
   ```bash
   # First, use veracity-search on the codebase
   veracity-search -C ~/projects/APAS-VERUS --no-vstd 'fn _ types X'
   
   # Then grep for specific patterns
   ls src/experiments/
   grep -r "pattern" src/experiments/
   ```

3. **If not found**: Propose a new experiment file at `src/experiments/X.rs` to prove or disprove the case

Do not assume Verus can't do something without evidence. Many "impossible" things turn out to be possible with the right approach.
