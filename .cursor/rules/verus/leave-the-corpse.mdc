# Leave the Corpse

When the user says "show me the corpse" or "leave the corpse", this means:

- **DO**: Leave the failing code in place exactly as written
- **DO**: Let verification errors remain visible in the output
- **DO NOT**: Comment out the module in `lib.rs`
- **DO NOT**: Comment out the failing assertions or functions
- **DO NOT**: Add `#[verifier::external_body]` to skip verification
- **DO NOT**: Add `assume(...)` or `admit()` to force it through
- **DO NOT**: Revert or delete the failing code

The point is to preserve the failure as evidence. The user wants to see exactly what fails and why.

This is related to the `failed-experiments` rule — failed code is valuable documentation.
