# No Jejune Comments

Do not add comments that merely restate what is already clear from the function's name, parameters, and types.

## Bad Examples

```rust
/// Returns the size of the set.
fn size(&self) -> N { ... }

/// Checks if the element is in the set.
fn contains(&self, elem: &T) -> bool { ... }

/// Creates a new empty set.
fn empty() -> Self { ... }
```

These comments add no value—the function names already convey the meaning.

## Good Examples

```rust
/// APAS: Work Θ(|v|), Span Θ(1)
fn from_vec(v: Vec<T>) -> Self { ... }

/// Uses parallel divide-and-conquer; falls back to sequential for n < 1000.
fn parallel_filter(items: Vec<T>, pred: F) -> Vec<T> { ... }

/// The result excludes self-loops even if present in the input.
fn neighbors(&self, v: &V) -> Set<V> { ... }
```

These comments tell you something non-obvious: complexity, implementation strategy, or edge case behavior.

## Rule

A comment should pass this test: "Does this tell me something I couldn't infer from the signature alone?"

If not, omit it.
