# May vs Can

- **can** = ability (is it physically/technically possible?)
- **may** = permission or option (is it allowed/permitted?)

## Examples

| Wrong | Right | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| User can set this before use | User may set this before use | It's an option, not an ability question |
| You may call `len()` on a `Vec` | You can call `len()` on a `Vec` | It's about capability |
| This can be `None` | This may be `None` | It's a permitted state |
| Threads can be reused | Threads may be reused | It's about whether reuse is allowed |

## Quick Test

Ask: "Is this about whether something is *possible* or whether something is *permitted/optional*?"

- Possible → can
- Permitted/optional → may
