# External Repository Protection

**ABSOLUTE RULE: You may NEVER modify any file outside of `/home/milnes/projects/veracity`.**

This includes but is not limited to:

- `/home/milnes/projects/APAS-VERUS/` — the live codebase. NEVER run reorder, write, or any file-modifying command against it.
- Any other repository under `/home/milnes/projects/` that is not `veracity`.

## What you CAN do

- Read files in external repos for reference (grep, cat, read).
- Run the veracity analysis tools in **read-only mode** (no `-r`/`--reorder`) against external repos.
- Run dry-run (`-n`/`--dry-run`) against external repos.

## The fixture

- The ONLY copy of APAS-VERUS you may modify is the fixture at `tests/fixtures/APAS-VERUS/`.
- After any modification to the fixture, you MUST `git checkout -- .` to restore it before ending your task.
- NEVER commit changes to the fixture's git repository.

## Why

Running file-modifying tools (`-r`, `--reorder`) on the live APAS-VERUS repo pollutes it with generated content (ToC headers, section markers, reordered code) that then gets accidentally committed upstream. This happened and caused real damage.
