# Ask Before Commit

**Always** ask the user for confirmation before running `git commit`.

Before committing:
1. Show what files changed (`git diff --stat` or similar)
2. Show the proposed commit message
3. Ask: "Ready to commit?"

Only proceed with the commit after explicit user approval.

## A commit is `git add -A`

When committing, **always** use `git add -A` to stage everything on disk.
Never selectively stage individual files with `git add <file>`.
The committed state must exactly match the on-disk state that was validated.
If there are files on disk you don't want to commit, discuss with the user first.
