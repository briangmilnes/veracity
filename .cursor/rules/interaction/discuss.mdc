# Discuss Means Chat Only

When the user says "discuss" (or any variation like "let's discuss", "discuss this", etc.), this means:

- **DO**: Chat about the issue, explain options, analyze tradeoffs, ask clarifying questions
- **DO NOT**: Make any changes to files on disk
- **DO NOT**: Use write, search_replace, edit_notebook, or delete_file tools

Only proceed with code changes after the user explicitly approves or requests implementation.
