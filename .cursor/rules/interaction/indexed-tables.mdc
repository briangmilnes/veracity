# Indexed Tables and Suggestions

All tables and suggestion lists must include a numeric index in column zero (or as a numbered list) so the user can easily refer to specific items.

## Tables

Always include an `#` or `Index` column as the first column:

| # | Loop Type | Provable? |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | loop-match | Yes |
| 2 | while | No |
| 3 | for-in | No |

## Suggestion Lists

Use numbered lists instead of bullets:

1. First suggestion
2. Second suggestion
3. Third suggestion

This allows the user to say "do #2" or "explain row 3" without ambiguity.
