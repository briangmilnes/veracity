# STEP n

When the user says "STEP n" (e.g., "STEP 3"), this means:

- **DO**: Perform at most n iterations of file writing / verus verification
- **DO**: Stop after n iterations, even if problems remain
- **DO**: Leave the code in its current state with any errors/issues visible
- **DO NOT**: Continue fixing beyond n iterations

This allows the user to review intermediate states and understand what's happening.

Example: "STEP 2" means make at most 2 edit/verify cycles, then stop and show where things stand.
