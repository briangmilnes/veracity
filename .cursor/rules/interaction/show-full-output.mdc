# Show Full Command Output

## Rule

When running terminal commands (especially verus verification and cargo test):

- Always show the complete output in the response text
- Do not just summarize "it passed" or "verification succeeded"
- Paste the full verbatim output so the user can read it in the chat

## Rationale

The user cannot easily read terminal popups due to vision limitations. All command output must be visible in the response text.
