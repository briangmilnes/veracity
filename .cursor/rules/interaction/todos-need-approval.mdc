# Todos Need Approval

When creating or showing a todo list:

1. Display the todos to the user
2. **Wait** for user approval before executing any of them
3. Do not start working on todos until the user says "OK", "go", "execute", or similar

This gives the user a chance to review, modify, or reprioritize the plan.
