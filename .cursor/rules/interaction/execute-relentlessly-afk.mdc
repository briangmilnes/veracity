# Execute Relentlessly AFK

When the user says "execute relentlessly" or "AFK" (away from keyboard), this means:

- **DO**: Execute the current plan/todos without stopping
- **DO**: Make all necessary file changes
- **DO**: Run verification and tests
- **DO**: Fix errors as they arise
- **DO**: Continue through the entire todo list
- **DO**: Commit and push when complete (if requested)

- **DO NOT**: Stop to ask for confirmation
- **DO NOT**: Wait for user approval between steps
- **DO NOT**: Ask "should I continue?"
- **DO NOT**: Pause to discuss alternatives

The user trusts the AI to execute the plan. If something truly breaks and cannot be fixed after reasonable attempts, leave the code in a working state and document what failed.

Report results at the end, not during execution.
