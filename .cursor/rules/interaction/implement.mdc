# Implement Means Make Changes

When the user says "implement" (or any variation like "implement it", "implement this", "go ahead and implement", etc.), this means:

- **DO**: Make the discussed/sketched changes to files on disk
- **DO**: Use write, search_replace, or other file modification tools
- **DO**: Verify the changes compile/verify after implementation
- **DO**: Keep changes focused on the discussed solution

This is the explicit approval to proceed with file modifications after a discussion or sketch.
