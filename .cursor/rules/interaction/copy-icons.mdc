# Copy Icons for URLs and Paths

When displaying URLs or file paths in tables or lists, include a copy icon (📋) as a clickable element to make copying easier.

Format examples:

| # | Type | Link |
|---|------|------|
| 1 | URL | 📋 `https://example.com/path` |
| 2 | File | 📋 `/home/user/project/file.rs` |
