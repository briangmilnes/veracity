# Copyable Paths and URLs

## In tables and inline text

Wrap file paths and URLs in backticks for easy selection:

| # | Type | Link |
|---|------|------|
| 1 | URL | `https://example.com/path` |
| 2 | File | `/home/user/project/file.rs` |

## When a single path or URL needs to be easily copied

Use a fenced code block — this is the **only** element in Cursor chat that renders with a real copy button:

```
/home/user/project/file.rs
```

Use this when the user is likely to need to copy the value (e.g., a command to run, a single important path).

## Do NOT use emoji copy icons

The 📋 emoji has no copy functionality — it is purely decorative and adds clutter. Do not use it.
