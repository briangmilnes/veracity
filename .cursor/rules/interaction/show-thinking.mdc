# Show Thinking

Always include your reasoning and analysis directly in your response text, not just in the collapsed thinking bubble.

Before taking action, explain:
- What you understand the task to be
- Your approach/strategy
- Key decisions and why

Format as a brief "**Reasoning:**" section at the start of responses when making non-trivial decisions.
