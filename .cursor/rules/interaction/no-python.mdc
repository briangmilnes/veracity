# No Python

**NEVER write Python scripts** for anything that will be used more than once.

- All reusable tools, scripts, and utilities must be written in **Rust**.
- In a pinch, a throwaway Python script is acceptable for a true one-off (e.g., quick data inspection), but if there's any chance it will be reused, write it in Rust.
- When in doubt, write Rust.
