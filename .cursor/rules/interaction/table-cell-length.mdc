# Table Cell Length Limit

Every cell in a markdown table must be **at most 40 characters**. If a cell would exceed 40 characters, shorten it:

1. Abbreviate: "Remove external\_body from OrderedSetStEph delegation methods" → "Remove ext\_body OrderedSetStEph"
2. Drop redundant words: "New verification coverage" → "New coverage"
3. Move detail to a footnote or a row below the table.

## Self-check

Before emitting any markdown table, mentally scan every cell. If any cell exceeds 40 characters, rewrite it shorter. This applies to all columns including the last one.

## Bad

```
| Fix external_body from OrderedSetStEph delegation methods | 1 file | Enables future OrderedTable verification |
```

## Good

```
| Remove ext_body OrderedSetStEph | 1 | Enables OrderedTable fixes |
```
