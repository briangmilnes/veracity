# Plans Directory

When generating plans, proposed work tables, retables, or similar markdown outputs that the user may need to read or reference:

- **Always** write them to `plans/` on disk
- Use descriptive filenames: `proposed-work.md`, `fixes-table.md`, etc.
- Do not rely on chat-only output for tables; the user may not be able to read them

## Examples

- Proposed work table → `plans/proposed-work.md`
- Proposed fixes table → `plans/proposed-fixes.md`
- Other plan documents → `plans/<descriptive-name>.md`
