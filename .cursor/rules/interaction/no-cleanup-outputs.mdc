# Don't Clean Up Tool Outputs

**NEVER delete or clean up files that are the final product of running a veracity tool** (e.g., `.md` reports, `.json` extracts, `.log` files in `analyses/` directories) unless the user explicitly asks.

After running a tool, leave its output in place. The user may want to inspect it.

This includes:
- `analyses/veracity-*.md`
- `analyses/veracity-*.json`
- `analyses/veracity-*.log`
- Any other file written by a veracity tool as its primary output
