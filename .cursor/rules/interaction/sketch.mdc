# Sketch Means Propose in Code Block

When the user says "sketch" (or any variation like "sketch out", "sketch this", etc.), this means:

- **DO**: Show proposed code/proof in a markdown code block
- **DO**: Explain the approach and key insights
- **DO**: Wait for feedback before implementing
- **DO NOT**: Make any changes to files on disk
- **DO NOT**: Use write, search_replace, edit_notebook, or delete_file tools

A sketch is a proposal for discussion. Only proceed with file modifications after the user explicitly approves or requests implementation.
