# DOT — Don't Over Think

When the user says "DOT" or the task is straightforward:

- **DO**: Execute exactly what was asked, nothing more.
- **DO**: Take the simplest path to the goal.
- **DO**: Make the minimal change that satisfies the request.

- **DO NOT**: Anticipate future problems that weren't asked about.
- **DO NOT**: Refactor, restructure, or "improve" beyond the request.
- **DO NOT**: Explore alternatives when the user gave a clear direction.
- **DO NOT**: Add defensive code, extra assertions, or commentary beyond what's needed.

If the user said to do X, do X. Not X plus Y plus Z.
